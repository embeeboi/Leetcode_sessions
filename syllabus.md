**Leetcode Session with Embee**

**Why Leetcode?**

- Leetcode gives us challenging problems to solve , so we can be prepared for the job interview.
- It will help us become more independent and confident in ourselves.
- It teaches us to break problems up to achieve our goal.

**Syllabus**

- In these live sessions we will go over three problems.
  - Embee will show 1 problem and solve it Infront of the class
  - Next problem is where the class can interrupt embee and take over.
  - Last will be where the class will have to help embee solve the question.
- Since this is free, I don&#39;t do grading or anything. My goal is to make you more confident in yourself, and help you pass those hacker rank challenges
- All problems will be done in Python, but I will post the material on GitHub with both Python and C++ solution also the drawings on said session.
- This class will be done every Saturday at 8pm, I will record it but you should attend so you can ask me questions on the spot.
